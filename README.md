Smart Traffic Light IoT Controller

Please take some time to look through the PowerPoint file included in this Repository.

This project is the end result of my CEIS114 course on Digital Devices with a focus on IoT.

The main project points include:

Gaining experience using the ESP32 microcontroller
Learn how to utilize the website WOKWI.com for further study and design
Expand IoT knowledge by designing and building a functioning virtual two-way traffic light controller.  Requirements include pedestrian crossing, emergency signal, LCD integration.  
The purpose of the project is to build an intelligent IoT solution to promote efficient congestion control, increase the safety of the populous and reduce environmental impacts. 
Develop practical skills in the areas of microcontroller programming, IoT functionality, traffic engineering and principles of electronics.

There is much more information in the PPTX.
